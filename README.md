Protein‒DNA interactions are crucial in life processes such as gene expres-sion and regulation. Therefore, the accurate prediction of DNA-binding sites on proteins is highly important for the advancement of scientific understand-ing in the field of biological activities. In this work, we propose a protein‒DNA-binding site prediction framework, termed Evolutionary Scale Model-ing-SE-Connection Pyramidal (ESM–SECP), which is based on the fusion of protein language models and a convolutional neural network. Protein se-quence features are extracted using the ESM-2 protein language model com-bined with evolutionary conservation information computed by PSI-BLAST. These features are then fused by the mechanism of multi-head attention and the SE-Connection Pyramidal (SECP) network for protein‒DNA-binding site prediction. Finally, a sequence homology-based prediction method is intro-duced to improve the prediction performance. Through the experimental val-idation of the TE46 and TE129 datasets, ESM-SECP outperforms the tradi-tional methods in several evaluation indices, demonstrating its outstanding performance in protein‒DNA-binding site prediction.
